# Install Kubernetes

To follow the next lessons in this tutorial, you need to have the following prerequisites:

1. a Kubernetes cluster
1. access to that Kubernets cluster (i.e. credentials to it, in the form of a private key in a `kubectl.yaml` file)
1. the `kubectl` CLI binary, aliased to `k`

There are many ways to get this. One of easiest ways to get started is to use https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start.

We may add documentation about other approaches later (e.g. `kind`, `kubeadm`; or cloud hosted managed Kubernetes offerings like Google's GKE; or local distributions like k3s.io, k3s.io, OpenShift, et al).
