# About Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is an
[open source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) container orchestrator.
Google initiated this project in 2014, [inspired by Borg](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/) (see [original article](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44843.pdf), the [original paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43438.pdf), and [second paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3342195.3387517)). It has turned into one
of / the most successful and active open source community, overshadowing earlier
similar projects such as Apache Mesos or Docker Swarm et al. Google is the
[company with most contributions](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/9/companies-table?orgId=1)
to this open source community.

The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) (CNCF) is the
[steward](https://www.cncf.io/services-for-projects/) of an
[ecosystem of 50+ projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) (and [sandbox projects](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/)) that has spawned up around Kubernetes, with [97k people from 177 countries contributing 1.3B lines of code, as of September 2020](https://youtu.be/u71aL6aVDPg?t=168) (and as of [August 2019, 35k contributors](https://www.cncf.io/cncf-kubernetes-project-journey/)).
There are many more Kubernetes related open source projects not hosted by the CNCF. There is also a vibrant ecosystem of vendors offering cloud native Kubernetes related commercial products, solutions and services.

Wikipedia has [Kubernetes' History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes#History), or
